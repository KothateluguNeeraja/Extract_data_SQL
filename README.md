# Extract_data_SQL
I created a Library database using **SQL SERVER**
**What I Did**:
Created my own library table

Added data related to books,MEMBERS,ISSUED_BOOKS

Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and Top 5 to fetch and sort records

This project helped me understand how a library system works with databases. I practiced how to manage and retrieve book and member data easily using SQL.
